#### A code snippet for generating a fun table to show your skills, based on TIKZ. I got this idea when making my CV, you can also put it inside your tex file. 

#### Usage: 

you only need to modify the contents inside 

```
----- start ------

      ...

----- end   ------
```

and then call it inside your document body

```
    \mygrid[...]
```
